				<div class="problem-text">
					<p>
						So you realize that there are alot in the tech industry.
					</p>

					<p>
						You've always dreamt of becoming a techie and earning in
						dollars.
					</p>

					<p>
						But somehow you are still struggling in the journey of
						making it a reality.
					</p>

					<p>
						You probably have undergone several bootcamps, acquired
						the necessary skills or even enroll for a computer
						science degree and haven't gotten a single gig.
					</p>

					<p>
						Having a high-value skill like this and still not able
						to land a job can be very frustrating.
					</p>

					<p>
						I fully understand how it feels because I've been in
						that situation before.
					</p>

					<p>
						Imagine spending 4 to 6 month learning a skill like
						UI/UX Design just to end up as broke as you were before.
					</p>

					<p>
						Usually the expectation everyone has before venturing
						into tech is: "after learning these skills, I should be
						able to land a tech job in an organization".
					</p>

					<p>
						That is how it ought to be but most people are still
						struggling to get employed even when they are qualified
						in their field.
					</p>

			<section class="solution">
				<p>Starting out years ago, I had this same struggle too.</p>

				<p>
					Until I discovered that it is one thing to learn a tech
					skill and a complete different thing to landing a job with
					the skill.
				</p>

				<p>It was this discovery that changed everything for me.</p>

				<p>
					Now I'm able to say that I am a Software Developer with
					years of experience.
				</p>

				<p>
					And for the first time, I am sharing all the stategies that
					have helped me achieved that in my brand new ebook:
					"Complete Roadmap To Landing A Tech Job : Attain Your Dream
					Tech Job With No Degree And Experience".
				</p>

				<p>
					Unfortunately, most bootcamps and colleges out there usually
					focus on teaching you the skills, negleting the aftermath
					and business side of skills.
				</p>

				<p>
					Now you have the skills, but it's not profitable....what
					then is the use?
				</p>

				<p>This book will teach you the aftermath of tech skills</p>

				<p>
					You might already have the skills needed, you need to know
					how to navigate your way into tech organizations like
					Google, Facebook, SquareSpace e.t.c
				</p>

				<p>
					You don't need to spend months learning a new skill again.
				</p>

				<p>
					What you need is a roadmap to help you land a role into a
					reputable tech company with your skills and that's exactly
					what you will get from this book.
